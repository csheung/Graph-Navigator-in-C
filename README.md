# Graph Navigator

Graph Navigator is a C program designed to create graphs and find the shortest paths between all graph nodes. The program was developed on MacOS terminal and uses Linux tools such as Vim and tmux. Memory leakages have been identified using Valgrind, and the reasons behind them have been assessed using the GNU Debugger.<br>

### Features
- Create and design graphs with nodes and edges
- Find every shortest path between all graph nodes
- Utilizes a building priority queue
- Developed using C on MacOS terminal and Linux tools

### File Structure
main.c: The main program file to test Graph Navigator<br>
my_dll.h: Header file for doubly linked list functions to build and manage the doubly linked list<br>
my_pq.h: Header file for priority queue functions to build and manage the priority queue<br>
my_graph.h: Header file for graph functions to create graphs with nodes and edges<br>
my_shortest.h: Header file for shortest path functions to find all the shortest paths from one node to every other node<br>
